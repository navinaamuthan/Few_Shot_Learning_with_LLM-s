## 🎯 How It Works

### Few-Shot Learning Process

1. **Task Selection**: Choose from sentiment analysis, text classification, or entity extraction
2. **Example Configuration**: Select 0-5 training examples (shots)
3. **Prompt Construction**: Application builds structured prompts with examples
4. **Response Generation**: Simulated LLM processes the prompt and provides output
5. **Analysis**: Compare responses across different shot counts

### Simulation Engine

The application uses a sophisticated simulation engine that:
- **Mimics Real LLM Behavior**: Response quality improves with more examples
- **Models Performance Curves**: Realistic accuracy improvements with diminishing returns
- **Simulates Cost Metrics**: Token usage and response time calculations
- **Provides Consistent Results**: Deterministic responses for educational purposes
